          You can usually find me on the weekends watching re-runs of Suits, or creating webistes that are seamless yet immersive experiences. As said by Dieter Rams " Good Design Is Honest" but I'd  preclude that quote with a preface: "Not All Honest Design Is Good". So, why not give me a shot, you'll enjoy having me as an employee.
